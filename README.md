# Description

This is a template that I want to be able to use in order to quickly bootstrap a Next.js site. 

It is built on top of create-next-app, with my preferred file structure, default styles, etc.

## Notable Features

- Common default styles/utility classes that I use
- File structure with `/components` and `/utils` folders
- Dummy navigation/routing set up out of the box
- built-in `<Head>` component with meta/seo stuffs
